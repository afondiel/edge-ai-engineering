# Edge Deployment Strategies

## Containerization for Edge AI
- Docker containers for edge devices
- Kubernetes for edge orchestration
- Lightweight alternatives (e.g., Balena)

## Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates
- Secure OTA protocols
- Delta updates for resource-constrained devices
- Rollback mechanisms and version control

## Edge Orchestration
- Distributed model serving
- Load balancing and auto-scaling
- Service mesh for edge AI applications

## CI/CD for Edge AI
- Automated testing for edge deployments
- Continuous monitoring and retraining
- A/B testing in edge environments

## Multi-Tenancy and Resource Allocation
- Isolation techniques for shared edge resources
- Quality of Service (QoS) management
- Dynamic resource allocation based on priorities

## Edge-Cloud Synergy
- Hybrid deployment models
- Data synchronization strategies
- Fallback mechanisms to cloud

## Industry-Specific Deployment Considerations
- Autonomous systems: safety-critical deployments
- Healthcare: HIPAA-compliant edge AI
- Retail: distributed deployment across store networks
